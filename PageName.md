pyriff - RIFF form disassembly.

# Introduction #

This package exists to provide a way to disassemble various RIFF files, given a known structure, via the creation of a few simple classes.


# Details #

In its current incarnation the riff package can be used as the basis of a set of classes to disassemble any RIFF form.

Future plans:

  * Add RIFF form creation.
  * Add support for standard RIFF forms (wav, soundfont etc).
